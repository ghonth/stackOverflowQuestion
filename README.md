# stackOverflowQuestion
Place to host a file for my stackoverflow question

The data in the associated .csv file is a sanitized version of the data I'm working with. It consists of 5300 nodes in 1300 groups, and it has over 880,000 edges.

The main thing I want my python code to do is, when I hover over a node, I want line segments to appear between that node and every other node that's in the same group; this I was able to do by repurposing the code in the example at this URL: https://docs.bokeh.org/en/2.4.3/docs/user_guide/interaction/callbacks.html#customjs-for-hover-tool
